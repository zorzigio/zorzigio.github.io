      <description>This site is built using Hugo, a very fast static site generator built in golang that translates markdown files into websites.
The base theme I am using is PaperMod but I heavily modified it to fit my needs.
You can take a look at the source code on GitHub</description>

      <description>During this period, I have also undertaken a project on wind turbine wakes where I have used MATLAB and MS Access to mine SCADA data in order to asses the wake deficit of an existing wind farm. In the following stage I conducted a CFD study of the wind farm using ANSYS WindModeller in order to compare the results.</description>
