Led the development and design of end-to-end, high quality software, complex technical prototypes and delivered the MVP for Cybrik AI, a cloud-based (Azure) enterprise platform with a React.js front end, a Python back end and data ingestion using Apache Airflow. Designed and implemented the document search functionalities using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques reducing the time for our customers to find the relevant information. Scaled-up the company and hired additional technical resources to advance the platform after successful onboarding of clients onto Cybrik AI with the increase of the company valuation to US$ 5 million. Represented Cybrik AI, with CEO and COO, during its selection as a portfolio company of Techstars (the second largest pre-seed fund); demonstrated leadership, ownership, technical expertise and entrepreneurial skills, and strengthened pitching and business case presentation abilities, in addition to overall investor relations and senior stakeholder management. Led the recruitment and development of a team of 3 (a front-end developer, a back-end developer and a data scientist); defined requirements, deliverables, managed timelines and performance. Created Kubernetes infrastructure in Azure and built pipelines in Github to support Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery; Excellent knowledge and experience of various programming languages and techniques, including: FAST API for creating RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications and swagger documentation; Docker and Docker-compose; Javascript and Typescript (React); PostgreSQL, MongoDB; Elasticsearch; Azure and AWS; Kubernetes and Helm; Python libraries for machine learning such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
